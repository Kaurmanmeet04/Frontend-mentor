Challenges face during implementation:

1.One of the biggest challenges I encountered was ensuring the website looks great and functions well across all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens. Making the design fully responsive required careful planning and testing.

2.Another issue I ran into was achieving consistent behavior and appearance across different web browsers. Browser compatibility can sometimes cause unexpected layout shifts or functionality problems, so thorough cross-browser testing was essential.

3.Additionally, I aimed to keep the JavaScript simple and easy to understand. This helped maintain clean code and made debugging easier throughout the development process.

Features:

1.The navigation menu includes dropdowns for Features and Company, which open when clicked, improving site navigation.

2.Buttons like Login, Register, and Learn More have smooth hover effects to enhance user interaction.

3.The entire webpage is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly for both mobile and desktop views to provide a consistent user experience.
